📋 App Manual – Customer Feedback Kiosk
📱 What is this app?
This is a custom Android application designed to run on a tablet placed at the exit of an office or service point. Its purpose is to allow clients to quickly rate their experience using three simple icons (faces).

👆 How does it work?
Main screen:
The client taps on one of three faces:

😊 Good

😐 Neutral

😞 Bad

Thank you screen:
After selecting, a short thank you message is displayed. The app then automatically returns to the main screen.

No internet required:
The app works entirely offline. All responses are saved locally.

📦 How feedback is saved
Every response is stored in a CSV file, automatically organized by month.

Example: feedback_2025_04.csv

Files are stored in the app's private storage, so no one else can access or delete them by mistake.

📊 Built-in statistics screen
You can access the statistics menu to:

Filter results by date range

Generate an Excel file (.xlsx) with:
